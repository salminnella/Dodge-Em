#Dodge-Em

A Web-App game built with Javascript, HTML, and CSS.  
Using the controller on the screen, dodge the columns by pressing the D-pad, or Y, X, B, and A.  Keyboard arrows are also functional.

Known Bugs:    
The interface doesn't render properly in Opera for Macintosh.
It hasn't been fully test in older internet explorer browser versions 6, 7, and 8.
if the window size is isn't big enough, moving the character will also scroll the screen.

The full experience to judge the UI in Chrome, Firefox, or newer versions of Internet Explorer.  I'm not entirely satisfied that the user has to take their eyes off the game screen to click the navigation buttons on the controller. It also isn't very clear they can use the arrow keys on the keyboard either.
